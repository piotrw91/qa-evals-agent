    "title": "Personalized home page and search recommendations",
    "description": "As a returning buyer I want the Aurora Market home page and search results to be personalized so that I can quickly discover relevant products without manually browsing the entire catalog. This feature introduces a recommendations layer on top of existing home page and search APIs, combining browsing history, past purchases, and popular campaigns to rank products for each user segment. It must respect country, language, and currency settings as well as category-level restrictions (for example, hiding adult content for some markets) while still falling back gracefully for guest users and first-time sessions. The recommendation service should provide clear configuration options for marketing and merchandising teams, support experimentation such as A/B tests, and integrate with existing logging and metrics so that stakeholders can measure the impact of personalization on engagement and conversion. The logic has to remain robust when user data is limited, when tracking consent is not granted, or when external signals such as third-party audiences are temporarily unavailable, always preferring safe and relevant defaults."

    "title": "Typo-tolerant search autocomplete with category awareness",
    "description": "As a shopper I want the search box to suggest products and categories even when I mistype a query so that I can still find what I need quickly. This feature enhances the existing Elasticsearch-powered search by adding a low-latency autocomplete endpoint that supports typo tolerance, synonyms, and category hints across multiple locales. The system must handle edge cases such as very short queries, ambiguous terms that map to multiple categories, and language-specific variations while still maintaining a fast response time for 95% of requests. It should provide merchandising controls for promoted suggestions, allow business users to define synonym sets and blocked terms, and expose configuration for per-market behavior such as safe-search filters or category boosts. The user experience should feel responsive and forgiving, updating suggestions as the user types and backspaces, while gracefully handling situations where no relevant suggestions are available by falling back to helpful default actions."

    "title": "Multi-seller cart stock reservation and timeout handling",
    "description": "As a buyer I want Aurora Market to reserve stock in my cart for a short period during checkout so that I do not lose items to other buyers at the last moment, especially for high-demand or limited-stock products. This feature adds cart-level reservation logic that communicates with the existing stock services, taking into account that a cart may contain items from multiple sellers and warehouses. The system must handle partial reservations (some items reserved, others not), expiration of reservations after a configurable timeout, and reconciliation when a payment attempt fails or is cancelled. It should provide clear messaging to buyers about reservation status and remaining time, and offer configuration options per seller or category for reservation duration and behavior. The design needs to consider concurrency, eventual consistency between services, and a clean strategy for releasing reservations when sessions expire or users abandon the checkout flow."

  "QA-104": {
    "title": "End-to-end multi-currency pricing and rounding consistency",
    "description": "As an international buyer I want to see consistent prices and charges across pages, emails, and payment screens so that I can trust Aurora Market with my purchases. This feature refines the existing multi-currency support by enforcing a single source of truth for exchange rates and rounding rules across the cart, checkout, payment integration, and refund flows. It must ensure that totals shown in the UI match the amounts authorized and captured by payment gateways, as well as any amounts later refunded, even when promotions and taxes are involved. The system should support scheduled rate updates, clear versioning of exchange tables, and a well-defined policy for how long cached prices remain valid in carts, wishlists, and marketing emails. Business stakeholders need dashboards or reports that make it easy to understand currency effects on margins, and finance teams must be able to reconcile orders, payments, and refunds across currencies without manual correction."

  "QA-105": {
    "title": "Campaign promotions engine with stacking and eligibility rules",
    "description": "As a marketing manager I want to configure complex promotions for campaigns like Black Friday so that we can drive sales without accidentally giving away too much discount or breaking the checkout flow. This feature builds on the existing promotions infrastructure by introducing rule-based stacking, eligibility constraints (for example, country, user segment, or category), and strict start/end times with timezone awareness. The system needs to evaluate multiple overlapping promotions for a cart, resolve conflicts deterministically, and surface clear explanations to users about which discounts were applied and why. It should provide a self-service configuration interface for marketing teams, including preview tools that show how promotions will affect typical carts before they go live, and fine-grained controls for budget caps and usage limits. The implementation must ensure that promotions can be modified or stopped quickly in case of misconfiguration, while maintaining a reliable audit trail of changes for financial and legal reviews."

  "QA-106": {
    "title": "Self-service returns flow with dynamic eligibility checks",
    "description": "As a buyer I want to initiate returns or exchanges directly from my order history so that I do not have to contact support for every issue. This feature extends the post-purchase workflows by adding a guided, self-service UI for returns, which integrates with existing order, shipment, and payment services. The system must enforce dynamic eligibility rules based on time since delivery, product category (for example, digital goods or hygiene products with stricter policies), and order state while correctly calculating expected refund amounts for partial and multi-shipment returns. It should present clear explanations of why items are or are not eligible, offer options such as exchange, refund to original payment method, or store credit where allowed, and handle country-specific legal requirements. Back-office tools for support and operations teams need a consolidated view of return requests, statuses, and financial impact so that they can manage exceptions and optimize policies over time."

    "title": "Seller portal bulk catalog and price management",
    "description": "As a marketplace seller I want to upload and manage my catalog in bulk so that I can efficiently keep prices and stock up to date across many products. This feature enhances the seller portal with CSV and API-based bulk operations for creating, updating, and deactivating listings, including fields such as variants, images, categories, taxes, and shipping attributes. It must provide robust validation feedback (for example, line-level errors), transactional behavior where possible, and clear audit logs for compliance and support. The system should integrate with existing indexing and caching pipelines so that approved changes propagate quickly to search results and product detail pages, without causing inconsistent states across different user touchpoints. Role-based access control and detailed activity logs are required so that marketplace operators can track who changed what and quickly resolve disputes or operational incidents."

  "QA-108": {
    "title": "Unified order and shipment tracking timeline for buyers",
    "description": "As a buyer I want a single, easy-to-understand timeline that shows both order and shipment events so that I always know where my purchase stands. This feature introduces a consolidated tracking view on the order details page that merges order status (for example, Pending, Paid, Packed) with shipment status (for example, Shipped, In Transit, Out for Delivery, Delivered, Returned) obtained from multiple carriers. The UI must handle multiple shipments per order, late or missing carrier updates, and edge cases such as lost or returned packages while still presenting a coherent narrative to the user. It should offer deep links to carrier sites where appropriate, configurable notification rules for different types of events, and clear guidance to buyers on next steps when something goes wrong, such as delayed or lost packages. Internally, the system needs a consistent data model for ingesting and normalizing tracking information from diverse carrier APIs so that customer service and analytics have a reliable view of delivery performance."

  "QA-109": {
    "title": "Premium membership benefits and free-shipping logic",
    "description": "As a premium member I want Aurora Market to automatically apply my benefits, such as free or discounted shipping, so that I clearly see the value of my subscription. This feature formalizes how premium benefits are calculated and applied across search, product pages, cart, and checkout, including special badges, exclusive deals, and shipping rule overrides. The system must ensure that premium logic interacts correctly with existing promotions, multi-seller carts, and country-specific shipping carriers while preventing benefits from leaking to non-premium accounts or guest sessions. It should include clear lifecycle management of memberships, covering sign-up, renewal, grace periods, and cancellation, and provide transparent communication to users about upcoming charges and changes in benefit eligibility. Business stakeholders need reporting on adoption, churn, and incremental revenue attributable to premium so they can fine-tune pricing, benefit structure, and marketing campaigns."

  "QA-110": {
    "title": "Fraud and risk insights dashboard for support agents",
    "description": "As a support agent I want a consolidated view of risk and fraud signals for an order so that I can make better decisions about escalations, refunds, and manual interventions. This feature layers a risk summary panel into the internal support tools, aggregating data from the external fraud detection engine, payment gateways, login history, and shipping anomalies. It must respect data privacy rules and role-based access control, showing only the necessary information for support users while keeping sensitive raw signals hidden or redacted. The dashboard should surface clear, human-readable explanations of key risk indicators, allow agents to record their decisions, and automatically trigger downstream actions such as placing holds, requesting additional verification, or notifying specialized fraud teams. Over time, the system needs to expose enough structured data to support refinement of fraud models and policies while remaining transparent and understandable to non-technical stakeholders."
