    "long_description": "Aurora Market is a large-scale e-commerce marketplace inspired by platforms like Amazon. It serves millions of users across multiple countries, allowing them to search, compare, and purchase products from both the platform itself and third-party marketplace sellers. The platform must support a wide range of product categories, from low-risk items like books to high-risk and high-value items like electronics.\n\nThe typical end user journey begins with discovery: landing on the home page, browsing categories, and using search. Search is powered by an Elasticsearch cluster and includes features such as autocomplete, typo tolerance, and multiple filters and sort options. This means that changes in search relevance or indexing can significantly affect user experience and business KPIs like click-through rate and conversion. From a QA perspective, any work that touches search, catalogs, or filters needs both functional checks (results are correct for given inputs) and qualitative checks (results are reasonably relevant and stable over time).\n\nOnce users find interesting products, they visit product detail pages. These pages aggregate data from multiple services: product metadata, pricing and stock, user reviews, recommendation models, and seller information. The UI needs to gracefully handle partial failures—if reviews are temporarily unavailable, the product should still be purchasable. QA engineers consider both the correctness of business rules (e.g., which price to show when multiple promotions apply) and the resilience of the UI when back-end services are slow or return errors.\n\nThe cart and checkout flows are among the most critical parts of the system. Aurora Market supports multi-seller carts, multiple currencies, and several payment methods. Shipping options depend on the user’s location, the seller’s capabilities, and product attributes (e.g., hazardous or bulky items). This results in a large combinatorial space for testing. Test planning uses this project context to propose representative but high-value scenarios instead of attempting exhaustive combinations. Typical distinctions include guest checkout vs logged-in checkout, premium vs non-premium users, and single-seller vs multi-seller carts.\n\nPayments and orders rely heavily on integrations with external providers: payment gateways, tax calculators, shipment carriers, and anti-fraud systems. These integrations are often responsible for a significant portion of production incidents. For example, if the tax service is unavailable, the system may need to block checkout or fall back to approximate tax rules. If the payment gateway times out after the amount was reserved, the system must correctly reconcile the order and payment state to avoid double charges or missing orders. QA engineers keep these edge cases in mind when generating test ideas, especially around error handling, retries, and idempotency.\n\nPost-purchase flows include order tracking, returns, refunds, and customer support. Aurora Market aims to be user-friendly, so customers should always know the status of their orders and have straightforward paths to resolve problems. Return eligibility is based on product type and time since delivery, with certain categories (e.g., digital goods or hygiene products) having stricter rules. Refund logic is often complex, particularly for partial returns, multiple shipments per order, and multiple payment methods (e.g., wallet plus card). Historically, many subtle bugs have emerged here, so these flows are considered high-risk and often warrant detailed regression testing whenever related code changes.\n\nOn the seller side, a dedicated portal allows marketplace sellers to manage catalog, pricing, and stock. Security and data isolation are paramount: sellers must not be able to see or modify other sellers’ data. Changes in the seller portal directly affect what buyers see: price updates, stock changes, and new product listings propagate through background jobs and caches into customer-facing services. QA work therefore covers not just the seller UI itself but also the propagation of changes across the system, including potential delays and eventual consistency issues.\n\nFrom a non-functional perspective, Aurora Market has strict performance and availability requirements. The platform must remain reliable during traffic spikes such as seasonal campaigns or flash sales. Many users arrive via marketing campaigns that send them directly into search results or specific product pages, so any regression in those areas can have immediate business impact. The team uses both automated performance tests and synthetic monitoring to detect degradations early. This context is also used to derive performance-related test ideas when reviewing features that might affect query complexity, caching, or indexing.\n\nThe QA process itself is designed around fast iteration and continuous delivery. Features are developed behind feature flags so they can be safely deployed to production but only exposed to a subset of users or internal testers. The team relies on a combination of automated tests (unit, API, and a targeted set of UI tests) and focused exploratory testing sessions. When a Jira ticket references a new feature or bug fix, this project context helps infer which parts of the system are involved, what the typical failure modes are, and which regression areas need attention.\n\nOverall, the main purpose of this project description is to provide shared knowledge of how Aurora Market works: its architecture, constraints, typical user journeys, and known risk areas. It supports more realistic and grounded test design, helps identify potential side effects, and guides meaningful clarification questions when ticket descriptions are incomplete."
