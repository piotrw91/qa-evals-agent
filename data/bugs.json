    "title": "Multi-currency cart total differs from payment gateway amount",
    "description": "Reported by QA against the staging environment during regression for multi-currency flows. Steps to reproduce: 1) Log in as a buyer with default currency EUR. 2) Add at least three discounted items (with tax-inclusive pricing) to the cart so that the total exceeds 100 EUR. 3) Proceed to checkout and select payment in USD via the external payment gateway. 4) On the Aurora Market checkout page, note the displayed total in USD. 5) Click \"Pay\" to be redirected to the gateway and compare the amount shown there. Expected result: The total amount shown on the Aurora Market checkout page and the payment gateway page are identical in the selected currency, with no rounding discrepancies. Actual result: The gateway page shows an amount a few cents higher than the total displayed on Aurora Market, which is noticeable for larger baskets and causes confusion for the user."

  "BUG-202": {
    "title": "Search results ignore availability filter for some marketplace sellers",
    "description": "Found by QA during exploratory testing of search filters on the QA environment. Steps to reproduce: 1) Use a test buyer account and open the search page. 2) Search for a product where there are offers from multiple marketplace sellers (for example, a popular phone model). 3) In a separate session, simulate the stock for one seller going to zero using the seller portal or test API. 4) Back on the search page, enable the filter \"Only show items available for immediate shipment\" and apply it. 5) Observe the list of results and click into the affected seller's offer. Expected result: Once stock for a seller reaches zero and the availability filter is enabled, that seller's offer should no longer appear in search results or filtered lists. Actual result: The zero-stock offer is still visible in the filtered search results and looks purchasable, but the product detail page shows the item as unavailable when opened."

    "title": "Personalized home page fails to load when recommendation service times out",
    "description": "Observed by QA during performance and resilience checks on the staging environment. Steps to reproduce: 1) Open the home page as a logged-in user with some browsing history. 2) Use browser dev tools or a network proxy to artificially slow down the recommendation service endpoint (for example, to 10–15 seconds latency) or trigger intermittent timeouts. 3) Refresh the home page multiple times under these conditions. 4) Watch the main product sections where personalized recommendations should appear. Expected result: If the recommendation service is slow or times out, the home page should fall back to a non-personalized default layout (for example, generic best-sellers), and the page should still be usable. Actual result: The central content area stays blank, showing only header and footer, and no fallback content is rendered until the user refreshes again under better network conditions."

    "title": "Guest checkout loses cart contents after address validation error",
    "description": "Discovered by QA while testing guest checkout address validation rules on QA. Steps to reproduce: 1) Start as a guest user (not logged in) and add any product to the cart. 2) Proceed to checkout and choose a country with stricter address rules (for example, requiring a state or region). 3) Enter an address that is intentionally missing the required field and click \"Continue\". 4) When the validation error is shown, fill in the missing field and submit again. 5) After the page reloads, check the cart and checkout state. Expected result: After correcting the address validation error, the user remains in the checkout flow with the same cart contents preserved and can continue to the payment step. Actual result: The cart contents disappear, the checkout flow resets, and the user is taken back to an empty cart state, forcing them to re-add items."

  "BUG-205": {
    "title": "Premium free-shipping badge displayed for ineligible bulky items",
    "description": "Logged by QA during verification of premium membership benefits on staging. Steps to reproduce: 1) Log in as a premium test user. 2) Search for a known bulky or special-handling product that is configured in test data as excluded from premium free shipping. 3) Observe the product tile in search results and open the product detail page. 4) Add the item to the cart and proceed to checkout. 5) Review the shipping options and prices for that item. Expected result: Bulky or excluded items should not display any premium free-shipping badge in search results or on the product detail page, and the shipping cost at checkout should match what was communicated earlier. Actual result: The item shows a premium free-shipping badge in search and on the detail page, but at checkout a higher shipping fee is applied, contradicting the earlier indication."

  "BUG-206": {
    "title": "Seller bulk upload intermittently creates duplicate product variants",
    "description": "Reported by QA after running bulk catalog update scenarios with a standard test seller on the QA environment. Steps to reproduce: 1) Log in to the seller portal as the test seller with an existing catalog that includes products with size and color variants. 2) Prepare a CSV file that updates several existing variants and adds a few new ones, ensuring the file has at least a few hundred rows. 3) Upload the file via the bulk upload screen and wait for processing to complete. 4) After processing, open one of the updated products on the customer-facing product detail page. 5) Inspect the variant selector (sizes/colors) and check the internal catalog or stock view if available. Expected result: Each updated or newly added variant appears exactly once in the catalog and on the product detail page, with no duplicate entries for the same SKU. Actual result: Some variants are duplicated in the catalog and UI, showing the same attributes twice and leading to inconsistent stock and pricing information."

  "BUG-207": {
    "title": "Order tracking timeline stuck on 'Shipped' for returned packages",
    "description": "Found by QA while checking integration between carrier tracking events and the buyer-facing order timeline. Steps to reproduce: 1) Place an order that generates at least one shipment. 2) Using carrier test tools or mocked events, simulate the shipment being returned to sender (for example, due to failed delivery attempts). 3) Confirm in the internal shipment view that the status has changed to 'Returned'. 4) Log in as the buyer and open the order details page with the tracking timeline. 5) Compare the status shown to the internal shipment state. Expected result: When a shipment is returned, the customer-facing timeline should progress beyond 'Shipped' and clearly indicate that the package has been returned, along with information about next steps (such as refund or reshipment). Actual result: The timeline remains stuck on 'Shipped' with no additional events, giving the impression that the order is still in transit even though it has already been returned."

  "BUG-208": {
    "title": "Self-service return form does not show all items from multi-shipment orders",
    "description": "Raised by QA during testing of the self-service returns flow on multi-shipment orders. Steps to reproduce: 1) Place an order using test data that is configured to split into at least two separate shipments. 2) Wait until all shipments are marked as delivered in the system. 3) Log in as the buyer and navigate to the order history. 4) Click \"Return or replace items\" for the multi-shipment order. 5) Check the list of items available for selection in the self-service return form. Expected result: The return form should list all eligible items from all shipments in the order so that the buyer can select any delivered product for return, subject to the configured policies. Actual result: Only items from the first shipment are shown; items from subsequent shipments are missing from the selectable list even though they are eligible and visible in back-office tools."

  "BUG-209": {
    "title": "Fraud engine auto-cancels orders but leaves payment in captured state",
    "description": "Identified by QA while checking post-payment fraud decision flows on staging. Steps to reproduce: 1) Use a test card and account that are configured in the fraud system to trigger a late 'high-risk' decision. 2) Place an order in Aurora Market and complete checkout so that the payment is fully captured. 3) Wait for the fraud engine to send the high-risk decision back to the platform. 4) Open the order details in the internal tools and in the buyer UI. 5) Inspect the associated payment record and any refund entries. Expected result: If the fraud engine decides to cancel an order after capture, the platform should cancel the order and initiate an appropriate refund or reversal so that the payment record and customer-facing status are consistent. Actual result: The order is automatically cancelled and stock is released, but the payment remains in a captured state with no refund, leaving the money in limbo and creating discrepancies in finance reports."

    "title": "Account deletion flow leaves residual marketing email subscriptions",
    "description": "Reported by QA during verification of GDPR-like account deletion requirements on the staging environment. Steps to reproduce: 1) Create or use an existing test account and opt in to several types of marketing emails. 2) Trigger an account deletion request via the self-service privacy tools or support interface. 3) Wait until the deletion job has completed and verify in the Aurora Market UI that the account is anonymized or no longer accessible. 4) Inspect the relevant marketing lists via the integrated email provider's test console or logs over the following days. 5) Observe whether any new campaign emails are still sent to the deleted account's address. Expected result: After account deletion is completed, all linked marketing email subscriptions should be removed or anonymized, and no further campaign emails should be sent to the user. Actual result: Some marketing lists still contain active subscriptions for the deleted account, and scheduled campaigns continue to send messages to that address even though the main profile has been removed."
